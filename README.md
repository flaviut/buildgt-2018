This is the source code for the 2018 BuildGT 12-hour hardware hackathon.

This project was composed of two components: A webserver that would collect and
display the data, and a raspberry pi that would collect pictures and
communicate with the Azure facial recognition server.

These two components are located in the two subdirectories.
